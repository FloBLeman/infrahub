# Connect a Git repository to Infrahub

One of the three pillars Infrahub is built on is the idea of having unified storage for data and files. The data is stored in the graph database and the files are stored in Git.

When integrating a Git repository with Infrahub, the Git agent will ensure that both systems stay in sync at any time. Changes to branches or files in a Git repository will be synced to Infrahub automatically.

Infrahub also has the capability to integrate with a Git repository in read-only mode. This allows you to track a specific commit or branch in the repository. Infrahub will not be able to make changes to the repository and you have to manually update the tracked commit, when you make changes to the repository.

More information can be found in the [repository topic](/topics/repository).

:::info

In this tutorial we will use a Read-only Repository. If you want to be able to make changes to the contents of the repository then you will have to fork it and set it up as CoreRepository. More information can be found in the [external repositories guide](/guides/repository).

## Integrate the Git repository with Infrahub as a Read-only Repository

Currently the easiest way to add a read-only repository is to use the web interface.

1. Log in to the Infrahub UI
2. Go to `Unified Storage` > `Read-only Repository`
3. Click on the `+` plus sign
4. Complete the required information:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Name" default>
    The name you want to give the repository in Infrahub for identification purposes, `infrahub-demo-edge`
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Location">
    The URL of the external repository, `https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-demo-edge.git`.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Username">
    We can leave this empty, this repository is public for read operations
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Password">
    We can leave this empty, this repository is public for read operations
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Ref">
    The branch, commit or label that we want to track in the repository, we will be tracking the current `HEAD` of `main`
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Commit">
    Infrahub will automatically populate this to the current `HEAD` of the `main` branch, in this case we don't need to provide a value
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

5. Click the `Create` button

After adding the `infrahub-demo-edge` repository you will be able to see several new [Transformations](/topics/transformation) and related objects:

- 3 Jinja Rendered File under [Jinja2 Transformation](http://localhost:8000/objects/CoreTransformJinja2/)
- 4 Python Transformation under [Python Transformation](http://localhost:8000/objects/CoreTransformPython)
- 4 [Artifact Definition](http://localhost:8000/objects/CoreArtifactDefinition)
- 7 GraphQL [Queries](/topics/graphql) under [Objects / GraphQL Query](http://localhost:8000/objects/GraphQLQuery/)

:::note Troubleshooting

If you don't see additional objects under the transformations or `GraphQL Queries`, it's possible that the `Git agent` might not be running anymore.

In this case, you should run `invoke demo.start` first to ensure that everything is working.
